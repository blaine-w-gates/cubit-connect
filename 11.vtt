00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.740
My goal is to get rejected a thousand times in 2026 and I'm so excited for this because one

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.100
is going to help me to actively practice delusion. Two, the worst that they could say is no.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.200
Three, you never know who you can meet. The random person that you ask a question could change your

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.980
life. Four, it's going to make me practice my free will a lot more. It's going to make me do more

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.760
side quests. Five, you never know the opportunities that you can make whether in your work or a huge

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.000
brand opportunity, brand trip, you know, like, and the world is yours. It's going to make me more

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.280
bolder, less shy. The rejection therapy is going to make me less sensitive to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.980
rejection. I think it's just such an all-around great practice and that this is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.660
one of the best internet advice that I've seen in a very long time and I'm still

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.440
excited to try it.
